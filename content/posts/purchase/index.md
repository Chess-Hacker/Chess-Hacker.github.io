# Purchase ChessHacker
If you're on this page, we hope you're happy with the ChessHacker demo! To use our app without any time limits, you will need to buy a key.

## Where to buy?
You can purchase ChessHacker on [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/s/f9e884d55a). If you want to donate to ChessHacker, you can also do that on Kofi, but keep in mind _you will not get a key_ for it, just the knowledge you have helped a broke college student.

## Receiving the Key
After your purchase, you will receive an email in **up to 24 hours** with your key. If, due to some unforeseen circumstance, sending you the key takes us more than a day, you will get a **full refund** along with your key.

## Using the Key

Once you have the key, you will need to insert it in the "Enter key" field in the ChessHacker launcher. After you do, you will find that the Launch button now works for you and that the 3-minute gameplay restriction has been dropped, so you can enjoy ChessHacker without worrying about the time limit.
